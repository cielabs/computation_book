# Introduction: What’s the problem? Why should we care?
Introduction to Data Science in Journalism: Show video of people in the field doing the work
* TODO: Reach out to Xavier about real-time scenario about fake news on the web. https://www.instagram.com/p/CD_1rAbAnQN/?igshid=17riidpompq6v
* TODO: Reach out to Lam about participating in a brief video series on the impact of misinfo in journalism
* Context: https://t.co/cHrbsYrShR?amp=1
* Charge: Video end with charge to students to help them solve the problem.
Frame the problem
Outline structure for the unit


List of things to look for in science articles:
* Get list


Lesson 1: Where did this problem come from?
Lesson: Historical context of fake news
* Technology’s role in promoting fake news


Activity: Explore examples requiring them to look at multiple articles that are not and are (varying levels- different sources - Social media)  - CT approach? - Decompose the article, abstract the articles,... (look for guides) - Patterns
* Google Doc: Create a list of differences and highlight what we should be looking for
* Articles: https://sports.theonion.com/scientists-study-brains-of-baseball-fans-to-find-out-ho-1845081906

# Lesson 2: Analytics skill required
Based on the prior information you collected how can we use analytics to tell if articles are good or not
* Give list of things we look for
* (examples should be shown in TidyBlocks)


Activity: Have students undergo another analysis using a particular analytical technique by using a calculator. The students should come to a realization that this is a lot of work and there should be a better way (leading to Tidyblocks)


(Note: Need to do something with graphing.)


# Lesson 3: Introduction of skill
What are some tools that we can use?
Add the steps required for using tidyblocks
* Analysis
* Tie to the steps we have for what the students will learn


Activity: Remixing an existing TidyBlocks setup to see how changing the different variables or blocks can influence the outcomes.
* There must be some deficits in the model (or else why wouldn’t they just use this one moving forward)


# Lesson 4: Creating your own TidyBlocks
Define the problem and parameters of the problem for students


Activity: Students will create their own model to analyze articles
